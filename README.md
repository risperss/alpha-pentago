### TODO:
- Store lookups for 8 variations of each position
- Implement iterative deepening
- Improve heuristic evaluation
- Favour longest losing sequence when all moves technically lose
- Don't discard mappings for terminal node lookups
- Formalize Makefile/build structure

### MOVING FORWARD:
- Once traditional game engine can beat me consistently, implement neural network
- Use games from traditional engine to train supervised engine
- Try and implement Zero Knowledge engine

### NICE TO HAVES:
- GUI for playing against engine
- Opening books (if they exist)
- Server to host code (website to play against it)
